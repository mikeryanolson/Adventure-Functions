# Adventure!
<!-- 
This script is not for the faint of heart - it generates terrifying adventures that only the bravest can read! Turn back now!

Whoever wrote this script was looking to complete it quickly and now we need to clean up their mess. The main button doesn't work (they had one job!), and there's a lot of code repetition that could really be helped out with a function.

Load up index.html in your browser, and take a peek inside index.js to see what the problems are... IF YOU DARE!
